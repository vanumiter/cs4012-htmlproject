        <h1>DDoS Attacks</h1>
        <p>
            A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, 
            service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS 
            attacks achieve effectiveness by exploiting multiple machines and computer systems as sources of attack traffic.
        </p>

        <p>
            DDoS attacks are carried out with networks of Internet-connected machines that have been infected with malware, 
            allowing them to be controlled remotely by the attacker. These individual devices are known as bots, and a group 
            of bots is called a botnet. Once a botnet has been made, the attacker is able to direct an attack by sending remote 
            instructions to each bot.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Are DDoS Attacks Performed?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Gain:</strong> Ransom demands in return for stopping the attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenge or Activism:</strong> Disruption of services for ideological or political reasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Sabotaging rival businesses by making their services unavailable.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing Security:</strong> Malicious actors testing their capabilities or tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identifying a DDoS Attack</h2>
        <p>
            The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. But since a 
            number of causes, such as a legitimate spike in network traffic, can create similar performance issues, further 
            investigation is usually required. Signs of a DDoS attack can be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from single IP address or IP range</li>
            <li>A flood of traffic from users who share the same device type</li>
            <li>Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of DDoS Attacks</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Volume-Based Attacks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Consume the target's bandwidth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> UDP floods, ICMP floods (ping floods), or spoofed packet floods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Sending massive amounts of junk traffic to saturate the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Measured in bits per second (bps).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Protocol Attacks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Exploit weaknesses in the protocol stack to exhaust server resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, or Smurf attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Measured in packets per second (pps).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Application Layer Attacks (Layer 7):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Target specific web applications or services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> HTTP floods or DNS query floods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Measured in requests per second (rps).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Examples of DDoS Attacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Mirai Botnet Attack (2016):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Targeted Dyn, a major DNS provider, disrupting services for companies like Twitter, Netflix, and Amazon.</li>
                    <li>Used IoT devices as bots, generating massive traffic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>GitHub Attack (2018):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The largest DDoS attack at the time, with traffic peaking at 1.3 Tbps.</li>
                    <li>Used memcached servers to amplify the attack.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
