        <h1>John von Neumann</h1>
        <p>
            Von Neumann grew up in an affluent Jewish family, showing early signs of genius. He studied chemistry 
            and mathematics, earning degrees from the University of Budapest and the Swiss Federal Institute in Zurich.

        <h1>Von Neumann Architecture</h1>
        <h2>What Is the Von Neumann Architecture?</h2>
        <p>
            The Von Neumann architecture, proposed by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann in 1945, is a 
            computer design model that forms the basis of most modern computers. This architecture describes a system 
            where a single memory and bus system are used to store both instructions (programs) and data.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features of the Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Shared Memory for Data and Instructions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programs and data are stored in the same memory space.</li>
                    <li>This eliminates the need for separate storage systems for instructions and data, simplifying the design.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sequential Execution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructions are processed one at a time in a specific order, as stored in memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Single Bus System:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A single data bus and address bus are used for both instructions and data, allowing communication 
                        between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CPU is divided into three main parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs mathematical and logical operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and manages their execution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold intermediate data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Program Counter:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A register that keeps track of the address of the next instruction to execute.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CPU operates in a cycle of:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Retrieve the instruction from memory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decode:</strong> Interpret the instruction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Carry out the instruction.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advantages of the Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A single memory and bus system simplifies the computer's design.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Programs can be modified and stored in memory, allowing for general-purpose computing.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Using the same memory for instructions and data reduces hardware complexity and cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Widespread Use:</strong> Most modern computers follow this architecture, making it a standard in computing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages of the Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Von Neumann Bottleneck:</strong> The single bus system creates a bottleneck as the CPU can only access one instruction or piece of data at a time, limiting speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Memory Risks:</strong> Storing both instructions and data in the same memory makes the system vulnerable to accidental or malicious overwriting of instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Sequential processing can lead to delays compared to parallel processing models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of the Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General-Purpose Computers:</strong> Desktop computers, laptops, and servers are all based on this architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Used in many embedded systems where the simplicity of design is a priority.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming Models:</strong> Influenced how programs are written, with sequential execution and instruction storage.</li>
        </ul>
