                    <p>Historically, computing devices were only used for aiding people in doing tedious calculations. Throughout its evolution however, it rapidly began to become an all-purpose machine 
                        that connect people world-wide, no longer becoming a machine used strictly in scientific, or research settings. Computers have advanced into nearly every sector imaginable, 
                        such as healthcare, finances, entertainment, education and business. The integration of computers into our society has made it prevalent in our daily lives. However, as the 
                        world becomes more dependent on technology, cyber attacks will continue go grow bigger and exploit weaknesses in protection and existing vulnerabilities; often with the end goal 
                        of data theft or extortion. Modern computing is thus a double-edged sword; it allows us to host, store, and share information conveniently, but it can also allow for the malicious
                         access and manipulation of such information. As technology continues to advance, it's important to have a balance between its benefits whilst maintaining security.</p>

                    <p>
                        When someone says cybercrime, you might think of people living in their basement, sending fake emails to 
                        everyone they can find, trying to get your data to sell for a quick buck. This could not be further from the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cybercrime, over the past decade especially, has become a $1.5T industry with criminal organisations 
                        run like legitimate organisations. However, cybercrime is not a new threat. In fact, reports of these attacks go back decades.

                    <h3>Modern Cybercrime Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        The modern history of cybercrime began in 1962, when Allen Scherr, an MIT student, launched a cyber attack 
                        against the MIT computer networks, stealing passwords from their database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See, passwords had been set up to limit the time students had on the computers, so Allan created a punch 
                        card that triggered the computer to print all the passwords in the system. He shared these passwords 
                        with his friends so that they could get more time on the computer. They also hacked into their teacher's 
                        accounts and left taunting messages.

                    <h3>Escalation of Cybercrime</h3>
                    <p>
                        This “attack” would be tamer than most others that would follow. Soon, hackers were stealing tens of millions, 
                        then hundreds of millions, of dollars. However, not all hacks were designed for financial gain. Some were 
                        designed to wreak havoc, costing businesses and organisations billions.
