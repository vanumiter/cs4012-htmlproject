                        <p>Microprocessors are miniature, electronic devices capable of arithmetic, logic, and control operations required for the operation of a computer.
                            In the early 1970s, it became possible to pack thousands of transistors, diodes, and resistors onto a silicon chip less onto a square made of silicon less than an inch wide,
                            leading to the development of the microprocessor. Introduced in 1971, The Intel 4004, was the first of its kind, containing 2,300 transistors within it. Throughout the years,
                            the circuit density of microprocessors grew exponentially, with a single circuit holding billions of electronic components on its chip.

                    <img src="../Images/microcomputer.png" id="imgright" alt="microcomputer" style="width:25%; margin:15px;">
                        <p>Microprocessors have allowed engineers to develop microcomputers, which were small computer systems that had enough computing power to perform many business and scientific tasks.
                            Overtime, the functionality of microprocessors have brought about the computerization of various consumer products, such as microwaves, electronic game systems, and televisions.
                            As microprocessors became increasingly powerful, microcomputers gradually became more known as personal computers (PCs) as its capabilities allowed for marketability towards consumers who intend to
                            use them not only within professional spaces, but also for personal use.
