        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a social engineering tactic that involves threat actors sending fraudulent emails to users, with the intent of financial gain or to spread malware. These emails are often disguised as legitimate so that victims will click a link that will hand over financial or sensitive information or will grant malware access to their computer.</p>

        <h1>How Phishing Works</h1>

        <h2>Impersonation:</h2>
        <p>Attackers create a fake identity, pretending to be a trusted organization (e.g., banks, tech companies, or government agencies).</p>

        <h2>Delivery of Bait:</h2>
        <p>Fraudulent emails, SMS, or messages (often appearing legitimate) are sent to potential victims. These messages include urgent calls to action, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Your account has been compromised. Click here to reset your password."</li>
            <li>"You've won a prize! Claim it now."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Execution:</h2>
        <p>Victims are directed to fake websites designed to resemble legitimate ones. They unknowingly enter sensitive information or download malware.</p>

        <h2>Data Exploitation:</h2>
        <p>The stolen data is used for financial fraud, identity theft, or other cybercrimes.</p>
