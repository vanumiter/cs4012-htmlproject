        <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing is a social engineering tactic that involves threat actors sending fraudulent emails to users, 
            with the intent of financial gain or to spread malware. These emails are often disguised as legitimate, 
            tricking victims into clicking links that compromise financial or sensitive information.

        <h2>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</h2>
        <p>
            A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack disrupts the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, 
            or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks are performed using a botnet 
            â€” a network of internet-connected devices controlled by an attacker.

        <h2>SQL Injection Overview</h2>

        <p>SQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the most common and dangerous types of web application vulnerabilities. It occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a website's database through an insecure SQL query.
            SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to interact with relational databases. SQL Injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code in the database, often leading to unauthorized access, data leakage,
            or even complete control of the database.
