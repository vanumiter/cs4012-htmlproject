- Turing also determined that there are mathematical equations that can't be solved by an algorithm. This is known as the Church-Turing thesis. 
- Turing Machine is a theoretical machine , used to solve aritmethic equations. This machine was used a computational model. Which was used to test the limits of ocmputation. This theoretical machine aided the development of modern computers .
